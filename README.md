### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I am currently studying in the School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University. I work in the research group of intelligent computing and photoelectric information sensor. My main research direction is the application of Raman spectrum in medical technology. I graduated from the School of Computer Science of Northwestern Polytechnical University with a bachelor's degree.
